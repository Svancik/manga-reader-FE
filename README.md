## Description of the page

This project is purely for desktop, yet without mobile version / view.

Project is made up of following Pages:

    1) Home.jsx
    You can add  books (mangas) to cart, view detail of the product, sort (newest, price asc/desc, discount, most favourite), filter by category of the manga, select maximum price range, paginate, textsearch, proceed to checkout, proceed to login, proceed to register.
